\section{Results}
\label{ref_results}

The results from the the two literature reviews and the development of the anomaly detector are utilized here. The anomaly detector was created in Python with the STUMPY library implementation of the Iterative Matrix Profile detector. In this section, the datasets from Section \ref{ref_datasets} are tested using the developed matrix profile anomaly detection technique against different properties and anomaly types. The parameters for each trail are listed and the results are explain. Further analysis is performed in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{Hydraulic Simulation Dataset}
\label{ref_results_hydraulic_sim}
In this section, the hydraulic simulation dataset presented in Section \ref{ref_hydraulic_dataset} is tested  with the parameters in Table \ref{tab:hydraulic_sim_params} using the developed anomaly detector. The hydraulic dataset is the smallest dataset in this study and it outlines the performance and characteristics of the anomaly detector when using small window sizes.

% TODO: fix this section
In this experiment, the standard deviation multiplier is set at two for the detector. If the data follows a standard Gaussian distribution, the detected points would fall outside 95\% of the data present in the window, which would represent a high chance of a motif change at this small window size. The same principal applies to the rolling range multiplier. The recent range detection debounce multiplier is also standard given the small window size and ensures that there are not over-noisy or duplicate detections.

This experiment demonstrate that the developed detector is robust to changes in scale. Figure \ref{fig:hydraulic_result_fp} shows that the pressure and force signals in the system have similar shape but different magnitude. 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:cylinder_force}
    F = (A_1 \cdot p_A) - \dot{x}  | A_1 \cdot p_A | (1 - \eta)
\end{equation}

This relationship in the shape of the pressure and force signals is derived from the force pressure relationship described in Equation \ref{eqn:cylinder_force}. As the pressure increases, the force exerted by the hydraulic cylinder increase proportionally. Since the boom arm and end effector in the system are fixed, the end effector moves proportionally to the change in force. Figure \ref{fig:hydraulic_result_fp} shows small differences between the force and pressure which is a result of the modeling of the hydraulic boom arm as a flexible body, which introduces additional oscillation which affects the pressure.

Figure \ref{fig:hydraulic_result_fp} shows the detector was able to locate all of the motif changes which represent inflection points without false positives. This is a 100\% accuracy rate for the detector. The amplitude and waveform of the signals presented here are identical to the force signal presented above. The primary difference is the different amplitudes. The pressure signal is two orders of magnitude larger in amplitude, which illustrates the detector is robust to scale variations.

The shape of the matrix profile values in Figure \ref{fig:hydraulic_mp_hist_fp} is nearly identical for the force and pressure values. The two signals have dramatically different magnitudes but similar shapes. This shows the algorithm is robust to different macro data scales and explains the results obtained in Figure \ref{fig:hydraulic_result_fp}.

\subsection{Power Electronic Converter Dataset}
\label{ref_results_pec_sim}
In this section, the Power Electronic Converter (PEC) dataset is tested with the parameters from Table \ref{tab:pec_sim_params} using the developed anomaly detector. The PEC dataset is significantly larger than the Hydraluic Simulation dataset, containing approximately 300,000 time steps (~83 hour of signal data). The PEC dataset outlines the scenarios at which this detector excels and its performance for medium window sizes. The standard deviation multiplier is significant.

If the data follows a standard Gaussian distribution, the detected points would fall outside 99.999\% of the data present in the window, which would represent a significant outlier comparative to the rest of the data. The rolling range multiplier is disabled for this experiment since the outliers are not relational to each other. There are 4 different types of outliers which all have radically different behaviors and signal shapes, so it is not desired to compare or remember them in the context of the next outlier. The recent range detection debounce multiplier is only one due to the larger size of the time series window and overall window size.

\begin{table}[H]

	recent & 1 & Recent Detection Debounce\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:pec_sim_params}
\end{table}

Because of the scale variance of the anomalies, only 2 of the 4 detected anomalies are visually represented in Figure \ref{fig:pec_mp_hist}. The two anomalies that are not depicted show similar patterns, but at much smaller scale. This shows the detector is able to perform on signals with widely differing anomaly characteristics and patterns.

Figure \ref{fig:pec_outliers} shows the detector accurately determined the start and end of each anomaly (100\% detection rate) with no false positives (0\% error rate). It detects the start and end of each anomaly within 1 window size (from Table \ref{tab:pec_sim_params}), although detecting the ending of an anomaly sometimes takes more time than detecting the start. By nature, anomalies are rare so interpreting the detection and false positive rates in a traditional way is not possible. The interpretation of the results and significance are provided in Section \ref{sec:discussion}.

\subsection{Cyber Security BETH Dataset}
\label{ref_results_beth_sim}
In this section, the BETH dataset presented in Section \ref{ref_beth_dataset} is tested  using the parameters in Table \ref{tab:beth_sim_params} with the developed detector. The BETH is the largest in the study, containing approximately 800,000 time steps (~9 days of signal data). It outlines the most challenging of the test scenarios for the detector and its performance for large window sizes. If the data follows a standard Gaussian distribution, the detected points would fall outside 99.7\% of the data present in the window. The rolling range multiplier is set to one below the standard deviation multiplier for this experiment which enables recall of previous outliers, but more heavily weights the present outlier detection score. The attacks have been manually labelled and although there are different kinds of attacks, the baseline signal (userId) remains the same. The recent range detection debounce multiplier is two due to the nature and volatility of the data.

\begin{table}[H]

\caption{BETH Dataset Model Parameters}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|}
    \hline
	\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline

	range & 2 & Rolling Range Multiplier\\ \hline
	recent & 2 & Recent Detection Debounce\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:beth_sim_params}
\end{table}
 
In this study, the outliers are only present when there is a significantly large range spike as shown near time step 200,000. The regular and periodic small peaks shown in Figure \ref{fig:beth_mp_hist} are not outliers and the rolling range technique ensures they do not trigger the detector. This provides an example of how the rolling range parameter can be used to tune the memory and ability of the detector.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:beth_detection_results} illustrates that the algorithm was able to detect the starts of the outliers within the debounce threshold and was able to detect the end of the faults with some delay. There are 2 false positives from the detector, which correspond to high UserID values in the dataset. These two locations are marked as suspicious so in this case the false positive would still be worth investigating even if it is deemed not dangerous.

Figure \ref{fig:beth_detection_results} shows that Authors \cite{beth-dataset} determined that many of the data points are considered suspicious. The Figure shows that only a few of the suspicious outliers are actually dangerous (evil in their taxonomy).

%         \caption{BETH Dataset Detection Results [Red Line = Anomaly]}
%         \label{fig:beth_detection_results2}
% \end{figure}

In this case, the detector is able to discern where the dangerous outliers lie among the very noisy suspicious data points.
The final fault that appears as two spikes is part of the same attack and as such can be classified as one fault instead of two.
While this is the most challenging dataset analyzed, the detector still provides a 100\% true positive identification rate.
For this experiment, the false positive detection was higher than in the other experiments.
This is problamatic but not critical as a false positive can be manually ignored.
